# About
Welcome — this blog is a personal archive of thoughts, experiments, and discoveries across technology, art, and curiosity.

Here, I document what I learn, build, break, and explore — whether it's reverse engineering challenges, creative coding projects, digital forensics, or the occasional reflection on systems, aesthetics, and the edges where they meet.
